Professionals in fine arts that might appear to be  beyond the use of computers are making use of computers <u>as much as</u> other professionals. Artist use  computers to experiment with design and color, sometimes using 3D graphics software. Computers eliminate the cost of having to experiment using actual materials such as paint and clay by providing virtual artistic materials.
